# airbnb-clone-project

This repository hosts the AirBnB Clone project, a foundational step in understanding web development principles through practical application.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are to:

* **Learn foundational web development concepts:** Gain hands-on experience with front-end and back-end technologies.
* **Understand MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture:** Implement a structured approach to application development.
* **Practice version control with Git and GitHub:** Learn to manage code changes, collaborate, and maintain a project history effectively.
* **Develop a scalable and maintainable codebase:** Focus on writing clean, organized, and efficient code.
* **Build a functional, albeit simplified, replica of AirBnB's core features:** This includes user authentication, listing creation and display, and potentially booking functionalities.

## Tech Stack

The technologies and languages intended for use in this project include:

* **Front-end:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (potentially with a framework like React or Vue.js as the project evolves).
* **Back-end:** Python (with a framework like Flask or Django).
* **Database:** (To be determined, but likely MySQL or PostgreSQL for relational data, or MongoDB for NoSQL).
* **Version Control:** Git and GitHub.
* **Deployment:** (To be determined, but potentially Heroku, AWS, or similar platforms).
